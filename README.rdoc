You need to create a .env configuration file as follows:

  FORWARD_HOST=http://www.example.com/
  USERNAME=mocker
  PASSWORD=mocker

Requests which don't have stubs will be forwarded to the url specified in this environment variable
Specifying USERNAME, PASSWORD adds HTTP basic authentication to stubs configuration page
